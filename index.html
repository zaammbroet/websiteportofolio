        <p>You always see other people happy, but you are not. Even though without realizing it, your life is also happy, many people out there want to live like you. When you are at the top, don't forget to look down, because when you are at the top you will meet people at a higher level too, so you want to be like them, if you look in the mirror you have more than enough, the key is to be grateful. Because your life will not continue to be on top, hey, please be aware, your life is not just showing material happiness, a healthy body is also happy, you still have completely happy parents, you have a partner who always accompanies you until now you are happy. Don't forget that. So, don't equate your happiness with other people's, don't want to be someone else. Life has a destiny.</p>
